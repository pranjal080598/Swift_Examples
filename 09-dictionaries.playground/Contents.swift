 ### Exercise

 Consider a real-world dictionary that you might read on your desk.

 1.  Create an animal dictionary where the key is the name of the animal and the value should be a string which represents the definition of the animal
 2.  Add ten animals to this dictionary
 3.  Iterate through the dictionary and print the keys and values in this format: `"Animal: X -- Description: Y"` where X is the name of the animal and Y is the description of the animal
 4.  Clear out the entire dictionary and then instead use this dictionary to store United States state abbrieviations and full names (ie CA : California)
 5. Store ten state names and abbreviations in this dictionary and then print them in this format: `Y: X` where Y is the name of the state and where X is the abbreviation
 6. Set the first state you chose to `nil`
 7. Iterate through the array and print each key and value and see what happened to that state you set to nil

var mydictionary: [String : String] = ["elephant" : "Africa", "Lion" : "California"]
mydictionary["elephant"]=nil
for (k,v) in mydictionary {
